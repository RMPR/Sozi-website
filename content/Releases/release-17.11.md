Author: Guillaume Savaton
Summary:
    Sozi 17.11 adds a few features and fixes several issues.

This release allows to selectively enable user actions when playing the
presentation.
The following categories of mouse and keyboard actions can be enabled or disabled independently:

* Presentation control: previous/next frame, toggle blank screen.
* Translation.
* Rotation.
* Zoom.

Sozi 17.11 is available in 16 languages.
Translations for Chinese, Polish, Italian and Lithuanian have been upgraded.
However, most translations are not up to date, so if you don't speak English,
French or Esperanto, you are likely to see some non-translated English text in
the user interface of the editor.

If you want to help translate Sozi to your language, you will find [instructions for translators](|filename|/pages/en/translate-editor.md) on this site.
Please [open an issue](https://github.com/senshu/Sozi/issues) if you want us to add a new
completed translation file or update an existing one.
