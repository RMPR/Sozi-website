Date: 2020-05-10
Slug: release-20.05
Lang: en
Authors: Guillaume Savaton
Summary:
    After one year, here is a new official release of Sozi.


Since Sozi 19.04, a lot of internal changes have been made to Sozi: code clean-up
and refactoring, upgrade of Electron and JavaScript libraries, build process.
These changes should be transparent for users.

Most changes have already been mentioned in the [release notes for version 20.03-beta](|filename|release-20.03.md).
In Sozi 20.05, translations have been updated and a few last issues have been fixed.

Sozi-export
-----------

[Sozi-export](|filename|/pages/en/tutorial-converting.md) is a set of command-line tools that convert Sozi presentations to
videos or printable documents.

Video export was very slow for frames with a long *timeout*.
This is fixed in Sozi-export 20.04.
