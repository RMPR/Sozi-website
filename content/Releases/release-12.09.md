Editor

Sozi 12.09 requires Python 2.7 and is known to work in GNU/Linux and Windows.

* Layers are now supported in the Inkscape extension. You no longer need to edit the SVG document manually.
* Several frames can be created without closing Sozi.
* Native language support has been added. Translations are available in the following languages: French, Dutch, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.
* Under the hood: Now using Glade for UI development.

Extras

* A small Inkscape extension in Sozi-extras allows to create hyperlinks in any SVG document.
