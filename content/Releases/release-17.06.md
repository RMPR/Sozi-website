Title: Sozi 17.06 is available
Date: 2017-08-20
Slug: release-17.06
Lang: en
Authors: Guillaume Savaton
Summary:
    Sozi 17.06 has been released in June.
    It adds a few features, fixes several issues, and adds new translations.

This release adds the following features:

* *Reset layer geometry*: clears all transformations that have been applied to the selected layers.
* *Copy layer*: copies the properties of a given layer to the selected layers.
  It can be used to realign layers when one has moved and not the others.

Sozi 17.06 introduces a new *Preferences* pane where users can edit the settings of the editor.
Currently, it allows to adjust the font size of the user interface, which can be necessary
on displays with high pixel density (HiDPI).

The desktop application is based on [electron](http://electron.atom.io/) 1.6.6, which
fixes issues with the user interface.
Linux users can install it using the provided installation script.

Sozi 17.06 is available in 16 languages, including Dutch and Lithuanian.
Unfortunately, most translations are not up to date, so if you don't speak English, French or Esperanto,
you are likely to see some non-translated English text in the user interface of the editor.

If you want to help translate Sozi to your language, you will find [instructions for translators](|filename|/pages/en/translate-editor.md) on this site.
Please [open an issue](https://github.com/sozi-projects/Sozi/issues) if you want us to add a new
completed translation file or update an existing one.
