Authors: Guillaume Savaton
Summary:
    This is a bugfix release for Windows users.

Some users have [reported a problem](https://github.com/senshu/Sozi/issues/120)
that makes the Inkscape extension unusable on Windows.
When opening Sozi, an error dialog shows the following message:

> glib.GError: Couldn't recognize the image file format for file 'sozi.py.svg'

Sozi 12.05 fixes this bug.
See the instructions to [download and install](|filename|/pages/en/install.md) it.

If Sozi 12.04 works correctly for you, you do not need to upgrade.
