Date: 2013-11-30
Slug: release-13.11
Lang: en
Authors: Guillaume Savaton
Summary:
    Bug fixes and small improvements.

A release candidate of Sozi is available for testers and translators.
See the instructions to [download and install](|filename|/pages/en/install.md) it.

As you may have noticed, the development of Sozi has slowed down since the last stable release.
While I am still willing to keep this project alive, I have had very little time to spend on it lately.
Rather than developing new features, I have decided to work on fixing bugs and improving the web site.

For this reason, this release candidate fixes a few bug and comes with small improvements.

* Hungarian translation

For translators, a few new strings have been added to the Inkscape
extension: you will be able to see them in context and propose
translations at [the Launchpad translation page for Sozi](https://translations.launchpad.net/sozi).
